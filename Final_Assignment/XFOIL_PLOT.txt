To suppress the plotting of CP plots in XFOIL:

Open .\Python37\Lib\site-packages\parapy\lib\xfoil\main.py

on line 166, below:
"if norm:"
        "write("NORM")"

write:

"write('PLOP')"
"write('G')"
"write()"


So it should look like:

    if norm:
        write("NORM")
    write('PLOP')
    write('G')
    write()
    # Generate NACA or load from file
    if builtin_naca:
        write(airfoil)
