Here are instructions on how to write planform files: 

-Do not include any blank lines
-Maintain the order entries
-Entry name can be whatever, however an "=" must be in front of the number in order for the code to read it
-A "#" can be after the number if you want to comment
-Dimenstions are in meters, angles are in degrees

-test_planform1.txt is a good example
-test_planform3.txt contains values outside of limits (for demonstration of error messages)
