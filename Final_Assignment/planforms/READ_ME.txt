Here are instructions on how to write planform files: 

-Do not include any blank lines
-Maintain the order of entries
-Entry name can be whatever, however an "=" must be in front of the number in order for the code to read it
-A "#" can be after the number if you want to comment
-Dimensions are in meters, angles are in degrees
-Wing span is only the span of one wing!
